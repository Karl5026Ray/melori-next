# Apple In-App Purchase — Melori Music iOS 1.0.2

Guideline 3.1.1. PR #339 made commerce unreachable in the wrapper; it did not
work, because the leak was never a route. This branch fixes what actually
leaked and settles the music question.

## Done on this branch

- [x] Commerce affordances: every price and purchase CTA outside a
      proxy-blocked route carries `data-native-hide`, so the pre-paint CSS in
      `native-app.css` removes it inside the wrapper.
      `scripts/native-commerce-affordances.test.ts` is generative and fails on
      any new one — it reproduced all eight live leaks before the fix.
- [x] Music and photo downloads are web-only — `/music/success`,
      `/gallery/purchase`, `/download-success` and the two signed-URL download
      APIs are refused for native requests. No IAP for music, so Stripe Connect
      artist payouts are untouched.
- [x] Snappd is a real tier: `classifyPrice()` maps 1499/14999,
      `membership.ts` grants it studio + gallery access, and migration 069 lets
      `profiles.role` hold it. Applied to production and verified. No backfill
      — confirmed nobody had bought it while the door was open.

## Confirmed in App Store Connect, 2 Sep 2026

- [x] iOS 1.0.2 build 21 is **Rejected**, submission 6c0eeca5, two 3.1.1
      findings: donations via a non-IAP mechanism, and the app accessing music
      purchased outside the app that is not purchasable via IAP (citing
      3.1.3(b)).
- [x] Paid Applications Agreement **Active**, US bank account **Active**,
      W-9 **Active**. IAP products can be created whenever they are wanted.
- [x] App Store Small Business Program enrollment submitted (15% rate).

## Follow-up branch — the Apple IAP server rail

Built and tested but held out of this branch: it adds a dependency
(`@apple/app-store-server-library`) and therefore a `package-lock.json`
update. Land it with a normal `git push` after an `npm install`.

- [ ] Migration `068_apple_iap.sql` — already APPLIED to production; the file
      still needs to land in the repo so the folder matches the ledger.
- [ ] `src/lib/iap-apple.ts` — JWS verification, explicit product→tier map
      with no amount fallback.
- [ ] `src/app/api/iap/apple/notifications/route.ts` — ASSN v2 endpoint
      mirroring `/api/members/stripe-webhook`.
- [ ] `appleCoinPackCreditReference()` in `src/lib/gifting.ts`.
- [ ] `scripts/apple-iap.test.ts` (43 checks) + its `test:unit` entry.

## Next — not started

- [ ] Reply to App Review requesting bug-fix approval of 1.0.2. Only after the
      browser sweep is re-run against production and the leaked strings are
      confirmed gone.
- [ ] Un-gate physical goods. Guideline 3.1.5(a) *requires* merch and photo
      bookings to use non-IAP payment, so `/store`, `/cart`, `/checkout` and
      `/book` should come out of `BLOCKED_PAGE_PREFIXES` and run on Stripe
      inside the app.
- [ ] Capacitor StoreKit plugin + native purchase/restore flow. Must come from
      npm: `ios/` and `android/` are git-ignored and regenerated.
- [ ] `appAccountToken` must be set to the signed-in Supabase user id on every
      purchase. Without it a consumable cannot be attributed to a wallet —
      Apple sends no email.
- [ ] Sandbox end-to-end: purchase, renewal, refund, restore, replay.
